# CAPM-Project
FnA'22 Summer Project

Assignment 1:
Importing all the libraries.
Use DateTime library to take start and end time of stock (first try with 1jan’21 to 1 Jan’22)
Use web.Datareader library to export Yahoo Finance as a data source. 
Take the stock for comparison of market return to be nifty(^NSEI) (beta=1).
Take the other stock on basis of your choice. (say, Bajaj FinServ)
Try plotting the absolute value of stock price of both stock in same graph.
Now plot cumulative return. (In simple word, assume you invested Rs.1 in both stock, so what would be its value on any day). Plot and visualize.
Now, add another column for daily returns. (Curr-Prev/prev).
Now, plot the scatter graph of daily return of both the stocks.
Use Linear Regression to find the value of alpha, beta, rvalue, pvalue, stderr. (alpha = intercept, beta=slope).
Now find the price at any time for the stock you choose before (say, 8June’22)
Now, using CAPM formula, find the value of theoretical return of that asset.
Now, you get expected price and original price. Find the error in this.

Assignment 2:
You would be provided with data of two stocks: Stock A & Stock B
Firstly, you need to plot the adjusted close data in for the two stock.
The, in the 'Model' page, calculate the mean, stdev, variance sharpe ratio, covarience, and co-relation of the two stock. (Remember, that the price of both the stock is different, so you must take adjusted value in calculation of all this data.)
Now, vary the share of stockA from 0,1..100 in the portfolio. (share of Stock B = 100- StockA)
Now, from the values calculated, plot the graph of mean v/s stdev.
From this graph, calculate the value of maximum sharpe ratio. (min risk max return)
