# CAPM-Project
FnA'22 Summer Project
Guidelines- 
Importing all the libraries.
Use DateTime library to take start and end time of stock (first try with 1jan’21 to 1 Jan’22)
Use web.Datareader library to export Yahoo Finance as a data source. 
Take the stock for comparison of market return to be nifty(^NSEI) (beta=1).
Take the other stock on basis of your choice. (say, Bajaj FinServ)
Try plotting the absolute value of stock price of both stock in same graph.
Now plot cumulative return. (In simple word, assume you invested Rs.1 in both stock, so what would be its value on any day). Plot and visualize.
Now, add another column for daily returns. (Curr-Prev/prev).
Now, plot the scatter graph of daily return of both the stocks.
Use Linear Regression to find the value of alpha, beta, rvalue, pvalue, stderr. (alpha = intercept, beta=slope).
Now find the price at any time for the stock you choose before (say, 8June’22)
Now, using CAPM formula, find the value of theoretical return of that asset.
Now, you get expected price and original price. Find the error in this.
